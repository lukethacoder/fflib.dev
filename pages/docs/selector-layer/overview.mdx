# Selector Layer

The selector layer is home to all queries for a given object. This encourages reuse of queries and builds a central place for adjusting the fields used from the object.

The selector layer offered by FFLIB brings things together and offers:

- Centralised place for queries with common fields.
- Allows joining other selectors so we can select common fields from other objects through relationship fields or even sub-selects.
- Provides security checks to ensure that the user has access to a given sObject and all of the fields. If required, this can be disabled.

## Naming Conventions

Given the reusability of the selector classes, it is recommended to name them as the sObject name followed by `Selector` (whilst excluding the `__c` for custom objects):

- `Knowledge__kav` → `KnowledgeSelector.cls`
- `Account` → `AccountSelector.cls`
- `PortalUser__c` → `PortalUserSelector.cls`
