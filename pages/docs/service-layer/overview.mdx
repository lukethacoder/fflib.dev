title: 'Service Layer: Overview'

# Overview

The service layer is home to the business logic within the application. Majority of code will live here. The service layer will interact with `Domain` and `Selector` classes, as well as other `Service` classes as needed.

Service layer classes should remain caller agnostic. Controllers, batch jobs and web services should all be able to call the same logic without any side effects. 

Creation and commiting of the `UnitOfWork` instances should occur here. `UnitOfWork` can be passed down to `Domain` classes to handle finer grain single object logic.

## Naming Conventions

Service layer classes only follow one naming convention, to be appended with `Service`. Prefixing service classes with a project name or group name is good practice.

- `PrefixName***Service.cls`
- `***Service.cls`

> `PrefixName` could be a type of service (e.g. `Community*`, `Internal*`), project name or namespace to keep similar service classes close.
