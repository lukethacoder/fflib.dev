# Triggers

fflib brings its own flavour of a trigger handler framework. Each **sObejct** should have its own trigger handler instance, and be tied to its respective [Domain Class](/docs/domain-layer).

## Naming Conventions

Triggers should be named as the **sObject** name with the word `Trigger` as the prefix:

- `Knowledge__kav` → `KnowledgeTrigger.trigger`
- `Account` → `AccountTrigger.trigger`
- `PortalUser__c` → `PortalUserTrigger.trigger`

## Basic Example

Create a new trigger for the **sObject**. Make sure you add the trigger points you need (`before insert`, `after insert`, etc.). The trigger should immediately hand off trigger logic to the respective [Domain Class](/docs/domain-layer).

```apex
trigger PortalUserTrigger on PortalUser__c (before insert, before update) {
  fflib_SObjectDomain.triggerHandler(PortalUsers.class);
}
```

## Testing

Trigger testing should be covered as a part of the Domain layer testing. The Domain test class should perform each of the basic trigger methods (`insert`, `update` and `delete`) so the methods can be properly tested.
